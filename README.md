## Usage

```
# Word frequency histogram
textalyzer histogram <filepath>

# Find duplicated code blocks
textalyzer duplication <filepath or directory> [<additional paths...>]
```

The duplication command analyzes files for duplicated text blocks. It can:
- Analyze multiple files or recursively scan directories
- Identify multi-line duplications across all specified files
- Rank duplications by number of consecutive lines
- Show all occurrences with file and line references
- Utilize multithreaded processing for optimal performance on all available CPU cores
- Use memory mapping for efficient processing of large files with minimal memory overhead

## Rewrite in Rust

This CLI tool was originally written in JavaScript and was later
rewritten in Rust to improve the performance.

Before:

```txt
hyperfine --warmup 3 'time ./cli/index.js examples/1984.txt'
Benchmark #1: time ./cli/index.js examples/1984.txt
  Time (mean ¬± œÉ):     390.3 ms ¬±  15.6 ms    [User: 402.6 ms, System: 63.5 ms]
  Range (min ‚Ä¶ max):   366.7 ms ‚Ä¶ 425.7 ms
```

After:

```txt
hyperfine --warmup 3 'textalyzer histogram examples/1984.txt'
Benchmark #1: textalyzer histogram examples/1984.txt
  Time (mean ¬± œÉ):      40.4 ms ¬±   2.5 ms    [User: 36.0 ms, System: 2.7 ms]
  Range (min ‚Ä¶ max):    36.9 ms ‚Ä¶  48.7 ms
```

Pretty impressive 10x performance improvement! üòÅ
